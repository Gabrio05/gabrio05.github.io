        Here are a bunch of reviews I wrote. I try to do one every weekend, but as you can tell, that doesn't really work. 
        But still, have fun reading! You can ctrl+f to maybe find a game or companies you like.

        I made this website myself! Which means it's visually questionable, but I've learned quite a bit of HTML and CSS
        doing it, and have a deeper appreciation for the poor frontend devs.

        I didn't and don't use any generative AI (including LLMs) in my work or what I write. You can learn more about AI and how I think about it
