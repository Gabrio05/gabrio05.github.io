        <h1>Various Things I Worked On</h1>
        <p>
            Here's the whole collection of basically anything I'm proud of. (Well I say the whole collection, but I'm still working on this page!)
            Kind of like an extended CV, some of it is in my one page résumé as well.<br />
            A couple of categories might blend a little, I tried to make it as clear cut as possible, but it's not always easy!
        </p>


        <h2>Work in Video Games</h2>
        <p>
            There's a couple of video games I did some work for:
        </p>
        <h3>Rift of the NecroDancer</h3>
        <p>
            Rift was an amazing opportunity for me. I got to playtest the game for them during development, which meant I got to see some of the work
            that goes into making a game, but also the specific development priorities before release and overall organization required for such a feat.
            You kind of know how it goes, but seeing it happen in real time with a game you genuinely enjoy and can learn from is way more impactful!<br />
            Not only that, but I even got to work on some official charts for them for the DLC, which let me in further on,
            firstly, how a freelance job works (this was my first video game job!) but also the communication required for everything to go as planned.
            With this, I appear twice in the game credits: once as a playtester, and once as an additional level designer.
        </p>
        <h3>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</h3>
        <p>
            Already a great game in English, I got to translate (with two other people) the entire game to French. This was a really cool experience,
            and taught me a lot about game localization, especially because we didn't (and couldn't) just blindly translate the game. Each line had to be carefully put into context,
            following localization guidance, and then the right translation chosen. Unlike maybe some other games, KTaNE really couldn't be literally translated,
            some modules required very specific words (such as homophones) which obviously couldn't just be taken from English (I still recall an endless conversation
            about the exact words to choose for "Who's on First"). It was a ton of work, not only because we had to translate the whole game,
            but we also had a whole bomb defusal manual to translate! But it was really fun, and I'm quite happy with the end results for the francophone players.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also translated Project Winter from English to French back when it was recently released. The French translation was poorly done
            (still not too sure what happened, maybe machine translation?) and I enjoyed the game quite a bit so I helped out. It was a solo job,
            but a lot of it had been done already, I just had to fix the mistakes and translate the few new lines they added. This was around the same time
            or a little after the KTaNE translation, so I was already experienced for it! The lines did go in the game for a bit,
            but eventually they hired a professional external translating company. (I was just doing it for fun!)
        </p>


        <h2>Video Game Tournaments and Casts</h2>
        <p>
            I've hosted so many tournaments in just a few short years, they're hard to keep track of! I don't claim this is an exhaustive list,
            but I'll try to add all the ones I remember! You may also start seeing a trend towards more "extravagant" tournaments... that's my style!
            Who needs boring and typical when you can get absurd and fun!<br />
            These are only online video game tournaments (I've hosted quite a few of in-person ones as well, but they're mostly undocumented).
            The tournaments are generally sorted by how much I like them, so read the first ones first!
        </p>

        <h3>Rift of the NecroDancer</h3>
        <p>
            With the recent release of Rift of the NecroDancer and my knowledge of the game as a playtester, I jumped on the opportunity to organize some tournaments for it!
        </p>

        <p><b>The Rift of the NecroDancer Invitational Championship:</b></p>
        <p>Currently ongoing!</p>
        <iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2620439237&parent=gabrio05.github.io"
                height="300"
                width="534"
                allowfullscreen
                class="right">
        </iframe>
        <p><b>RoNDOS:</b></p>
        <p>
            Coming from RoND (for Rift of the NecroDancer), someone suggested the name RoNDO to go with the game's musical theme.
            I thought that was a brilliant idea and added the S because the tournament is all about multiple custom charts!<br />
            In this tournament, players submit their own custom charts for the game, and I collect them and reveal them during the
            3-4 hour tournament one by one. Players only have 3 attempts to try and clear the chart sightreading it. The scores are tallied
            and the best player wins the tournament!<br />
            It's a lot of fun to organize, seeing everyone's creativity in the charts and players reacting to them live.
            I usually solo-stream the whole tournament so people not participating can still see how the players are doing!
        </p>

        <h3>SpyParty</h3>
        <p>SpyParty was my first real online game, with a wonderful community, and a tournament-era waiting to be organized... by me!</p>

        <p><b>Hidden Cup:</b></p>
        <p>
            Based on the Age of Empires tournament of the same name, this tournament has all players anonymized! With players unable to research their opponent in advance,
            their knowledge of the game is the only thing separating them from victory!<br />
            This tournament is a huge amount of work to organize. I have to manually coordinate matches for the players (since they cannot know who they are playing against)
            and then give them the match draft, accounts to use, and match time for every single match. On top of that, I organize the casts for the tournament,
            which means finding casters and a host and coordinating for a time, preparing the replays to give them, before finally sitting back, relaxing, and
            enjoying the players' and spectators' reactions (I'm the only person who knows who everyone is after all! Now that's fun!)
        </p>
        <p>It has enjoyed 3 total editions (with more to come?):</p>
        <p>
            Hidden Cup was the first and a resounding success. Its format was fairly simple as a tournament: just a 32 player bracket stage. You lose a match, you're out!
            Featuring names such as "Solid Snake", "Jason Bourne" and "Johnny English" to replace the actual player names, those 32 matches were a lot of fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the first one was so fun, how about a second one? The Hidden Cup 2 had even more players, but this time, I had a prime number of players, 37... Ouch!
            I guess I'll just have to say no to the last 5... Or I could make a really weird format to fit all of them! This resulted in a tournament format with
            9 groups of 4 playing a double elimination, followed by a bracket stage with 19 players. Featuring names such as "Expanding kapabacteria" and "Risible negativicutes",
            I'm... not too proud of those names.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, Hidden Cup 3, with an even weirder format. I placed players into 4 different groups, but they only played 2 matches.
            Those who won at least half would qualify for the bracket stage, while the others would be eliminated. Featuring clear and distinct names (thanks almost exclusively to
            an amazing community member!) such as "Princess Honeysparkle", "Two" and "Names Jond Bames Jond", as well as a casting schedule which was much more concise,
            revised rules to ensure it all went smoothly, and 2 Hidden Cup's worth of experience, this was one of the best tournaments I've ever organized!
        </p>

        <h3>Project Winter</h3>
        <p>
            I hosted a couple of tournaments for Project Winter. I'm not the happiest with how they eventually turned out (but maybe I'm too harsh on myself,
            and the last one of the three was actually quite good!), but I am proud of the rules I came up for the tournaments, so here they are anyway!

        I've learned quite a bit of HTML and CSS doing it and now have a deeper appreciation for the poor frontend devs.
