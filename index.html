    <h1>Heya! I'm Gabriel.</h1>
    <h2>I go by Gabrio online.</h2>
    <p>I'm a Game Developer interested in any and all opportunities.<br />I'm currently studying Games Engineering and making my own game on the side.</p>

        I've built this website as a means for people to see what I've done, but also for me to put everything I've worked on in the past in one place.
        It's very likely that if you come back in a few weeks or months I'll have updated this website with new info.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've got a few pages where you can get to know more about...
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="cv.html">My CV</a>. It's got all my education and work experience. You can also check out my 
            one page résumé there, or by clicking <a href="img/GabrielFaesCV.pdf">here</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="things_done.html">Various things I've done</a>. Basically the work section of my CV, but including voluntary work,
            fun stuff I've sunk time into, and many (many) other things that are worth mentioning.</li>
            <li><a href="reviews.html">Reviews I wrote</a>. I'm trying to write one game review from a holistic game design perspective every weekend,
            and here's the whole collection! If you're interested in knowing more about how I think about games and how they're designed, then they're
            all yours to read. You might find a review for a game you like and maybe even learn something new!</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>I love games, whether that's a board game, a video game, an outdoor game, TTRPG, escape room, you name it!
    Games are my passion, and I think people should know more about them. I've always felt like people don't take games 
    seriously, and think they are predominantly for children, when in fact they can be so deep with meaning, educational, and fun all at the same time!
    Because of this, I've made it my goal to educate more people about games for all the benefits they can provide (including having fun)!</p>
    <p>I'm a big fan of rules and how they interact; it's probably why I love games, math(s), programming, and so much more. Studying how each rule 
    affects the other rules in order to reach a certain objective is deeply interesting to me, that's how you figure out theorems in maths, 
    code something in a specific coding language, and come up with a winning strategy in games! I think there's a life where I would've been a lawyer instead.</p>
    <p>Music is my other passion. I started playing the piano back when I was six, and still regularly do! It's so fun to play songs you've listened to countless times
    and jam to them. I have a playlist of my favourites with around 3000 songs which is probably around 98% video game music (I'm quite proud of that one). I listen to music
    when I work, travel, or anything else really.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-GJEXoplSo" target="_blank">recent</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM3Wu3j-Vgo" target="_blank">favourite</a> 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBIo5QuEeaA" target="_blank">ones</a> which I'll try and update every so often!
    (It's already hard enough choosing a couple of favourites from recently, so there's no
    way I can choose a single favourite from all time!)</p>

        I made this website myself! Which means it's visually questionable, but I've learned quite a bit of HTML and CSS
        doing it, and have a deeper appreciation for the poor frontend devs.

        I didn't and don't use any generative AI (including LLMs) in my work or what I write. You can learn more about AI and how I think about it
        <a href="ai.html">here</a>.
