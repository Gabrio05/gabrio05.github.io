        This page is still unfinished, but I think it still serves as a nice introduction about AI, 
        or you can scroll down to get to my opinions directly if you're aware of the differences between different AIs already.
    </p>
    <h3>AI, What It Is, and What It Is Not</h3>
    <p>
        The Internet as a whole largely seems to misunderstand what AI is. AI, ML, LLMs, and generative AI are all slightly different things (and the acronyms don't help). <br />
        Artificial Intelligence (or AI) refers to an algorithm which attempts to mimic part of human intelligence. This can be achieved in countless different ways
        and has existed for a long time now, almost as early as computers themselves. The definition of AI is, in fact, so vague that truly anything that makes a decision
        somewhere based on human interaction could be considered "AI". I love AI based on that definition. Without it, you wouldn't be able to play against a computer 
        in any video game, or have cool interactions with NPCs in story games. <br />
        However, this definition of Artificial Intelligence isn't what most people think of as AI (at least from 2022 onwards). 
        Instead, most of them are referring to generative AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before getting to generative AI though, there's an important distinction to make between (what I call) a static AI (also referred to as a reactive machine),
        and a learning AI (also referred to as limited memory). A static AI has been programmed
        in a certain way by a human and is, in the context of games, what most video game players used to refer to as "AI" before the AI boom in 2022.
        A learning AI, on the other hand, uses training data to learn what the best decisions are in a given context for its specific problem.
        The distinction between the two can sometimes get muddy if a static AI is programmed to "remember" previous decisions made by the human agent,
        but generally a learning AI involves some Machine Learning (ML) tools, which almost always involves Neural Networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, generative AI is a learning AI which generally uses multi-layered neural networks (deep learning) to generate "something" (typically words or images)
        from human readable input. The goal of generative AI is to mimic its training data in its output. The difficulty comes from using input which it might never have
        encountered in its training data, yet, numerous Large Language Models (LLMs) and visual models now manage to do it quite flawlessly. Being able to generate such 
        consistent and natural speech and images is a marvel of engineering which I still don't fully understand and that we should not take for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, to recap, there's AI, which has two main branches: static, and learning AI. The learning AI models use Machine Learning and training data. Some learning AI models are
        generative AI and use Deep Learning (big Neural Networks) to generate content. A subset of generative AI are LLMs, which are trained to mimic human speech.
    </p>
    <h3>My Personal Opinions on Generative AI</h3>
    <p>
        The problem has never been with AI. AI as a whole is very vast and has many branches which have yet to be explored.
        Even learning AI models are not problematic and can be extremely useful (they were already used in various fields successfully 
        before 2022). The contreversy lies in generative AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to expand on this section further when I can (TODO), but in short:
        Generative AI models are a great tool and here to stay, but they are not
        currently at a level where they can reasonably do anything more than help you in a deadlock situation
        (where you have no idea how to continue, such as with an unsolvable bug), at
        least compared to just regular search engines, or
        when doing mundane repetitive tasks (such as answering emails, and even then I would not use AI, since the point of the email 
        is to communicate with you, not an AI agent resembling you). Add all the legality issues and more, and you end up with a bomb 
        which looks helpful (and sometimes actually is) but that can explode at any moment. <br />
        I urge people to be extremely careful of generative AI. You shouldn't trust the information an LLM gives you any more than you would an uninformed friend who knows 
        the whole dictionary by heart but doesn't understand any of it, because that's essentially what an LLM is doing, 
        except not with a dictionary, but with all the (right and wrong) information on the internet.

        I made this website myself! Which means it's visually questionable, but I've learned quite a bit of HTML and CSS
        doing it, and have a deeper appreciation for the poor frontend devs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't and don't use any generative AI (including LLMs) in my work or what I write. You can learn more about AI and how I think about it
